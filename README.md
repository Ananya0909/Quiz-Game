# Quiz-Game

In the past days, Quiz was conducted manually. It was difficult to manage records of participant’s  performance in the quiz. Moreover, time management was a typical task.

The “Quiz game using C++” is to facilitate the user friendly environment to all users and reduce the manual effort. The proposed system is highly error free and mistake proof as no information has to be entered manually thus reducing the human prone errors. Database of the user is stored in a record file. In comparison to the previous system, the proposed system will be less time consuming and is more efficient.
